## 🎯 Recommended Creation Order

### Priority 1: Complete OOP Foundations (Critical)
1. Finish Module 6 (5 remaining lessons)
2. Complete Module 7 (5 lessons)
**Why:** OOP is fundamental to everything that follows

### Priority 2: Advanced C# Features
3. Module 9 - LINQ (5 lessons)
4. Module 10 - Async/Await (4 lessons)
**Why:** These are used extensively in modern .NET development

### Priority 3: Professional Practices
5. Module 8 - Error Handling & Organization (5 lessons)
**Why:** Essential for writing production-ready code

### Priority 4: Backend Development
6. Module 11 - ASP.NET Core API (5 lessons)
7. Module 12 - Entity Framework Core (6 lessons)
**Why:** Backend before frontend - APIs are consumed by the UI

### Priority 5: Frontend & Integration
8. Module 13 - Blazor (7 lessons)
9. Module 14 - Full Stack Integration (5 lessons)
**Why:** Brings everything together into complete applications

## 💡 Tips for Efficient Lesson Creation

1. **Use LESSON_TEMPLATE.json** as your starting point
2. **Start with the analogy** - Get the concept clear first
3. **Keep code examples focused** - One main concept per lesson
4. **Common mistakes are gold** - These help students the most!
5. **Test your challenges** - Make sure they're achievable but not too easy
6. **Maintain consistency** - Follow the established pattern and tone
