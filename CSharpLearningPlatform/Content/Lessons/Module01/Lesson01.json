  "title": "What is Programming?",
  "simplifierConcept": "Imagine you're teaching a robot to make a sandwich. You can't just say \"make me lunch\" \u2013 the robot needs EXACT steps: pick up bread, put on peanut butter, put on jelly, combine slices. That's programming! You're giving a computer step-by-step instructions in a language it understands.\n\nC# (pronounced \"See-Sharp\") is one of those languages. It's like English, but much more precise and rule-based. When you write C# code, you're telling the computer exactly what to do, one instruction at a time.",
  "coderExample": "// YOUR FIRST C# PROGRAM!\n// This is a comment - the computer ignores it\n// Comments help humans understand the code\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Hello, World!\");\n\n// Let's break this down:\n// Console = The black window where text appears\n// WriteLine = Write a line of text\n// \"Hello, World!\" = The text to display\n// ; = End of instruction (like a period in English)\n\n// More examples:\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Welcome to C#!\");\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Programming is fun!\");\nConsole.WriteLine(\"I am learning C#!\");\n\n// Each instruction runs in order:\nConsole.WriteLine(\"First\");   // Runs 1st\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Second\");  // Runs 2nd\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Third\");   // Runs 3rd\n\n// Output:\n// First\n// Second\n// Third",

      "explanation": "Two slashes create a 'comment' \u2013 notes for humans that the computer ignores. Use these to explain your code!"
    },
    {
      "codeSnippet": "Console.WriteLine",
      "explanation": "This is like saying \"Computer, speak!\" It tells the computer to display text on the screen."
    },
    {
      "codeSnippet": "(\"Hello, World!\")",
      "explanation": "The text inside quotes is the MESSAGE you want to display. It must be in quotes so C# knows it's text, not code."

      "codeSnippet": ";",
      "explanation": "The semicolon is like a period at the end of a sentence. It tells C#: \"This instruction is complete!\""

    "instructions": "Write your first program!\n\n1. Display \"Hello, World!\" (the traditional first program)\n2. Display your name\n3. Display your favorite hobby\n4. Display a message about what you want to learn\n\nUse Console.WriteLine() for each line.\nDon't forget the semicolons!\nAdd comments explaining what each line does.",
