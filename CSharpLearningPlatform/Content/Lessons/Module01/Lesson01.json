  "title": "What is Programming? (Teaching a Robot)",
  "simplifierConcept": "Imagine you're teaching a robot to make a sandwich:\n\nYOU (to robot): \"Make me a sandwich\"\nROBOT: *stares blankly*\n\nWhy? The robot doesn't understand English!\n\nYOU (in robot language):\n1. Open bread bag\n2. Take out 2 slices\n3. Open peanut butter jar\n4. Spread on slice 1\n5. Open jelly jar\n6. Spread on slice 2\n7. Put slices together\n\nROBOT: *makes perfect sandwich!*\n\nThat's PROGRAMMING:\n• Computers are like robots - they don't understand human language\n• You write INSTRUCTIONS in a language they understand (C#)\n• Instructions must be PRECISE and IN ORDER\n• Computer follows instructions EXACTLY\n\nThink: Programming = Writing a detailed recipe that a computer can follow!",
  "coderExample": "// YOUR FIRST C# PROGRAM!\n// This is a comment - the computer ignores it\n// Comments help humans understand the code\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Hello, World!\");\n\n// Let's break this down:\n// Console = The black window where text appears\n// WriteLine = Write a line of text\n// \"Hello, World!\" = The text to display\n// ; = End of instruction (like a period in English)\n\n// More examples:\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Welcome to C#!\");\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Programming is fun!\");\nConsole.WriteLine(\"I am learning C#!\");\n\n// Each instruction runs in order:\nConsole.WriteLine(\"First\");   // Runs 1st\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Second\");  // Runs 2nd\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Third\");   // Runs 3rd\n\n// Output:\n// First\n// Second\n// Third",
