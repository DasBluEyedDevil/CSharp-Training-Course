  "title": "Inheritance (Blueprints Based on Blueprints)",
  "simplifierConcept": "Imagine a car factory has a 'Vehicle' blueprint with wheels, engine, steering. Now they want to make a 'Car' - instead of starting from scratch, they say: 'Take the Vehicle blueprint and ADD doors, trunk, and seats!'\n\nThat's INHERITANCE! You create a new class BASED ON an existing one:\n• The original class = BASE CLASS (or parent, superclass)\n• The new class = DERIVED CLASS (or child, subclass)\n\nThe derived class INHERITS everything from the base class and can ADD NEW features or MODIFY existing ones.\n\nExample: Animal (base) → Dog (derived)\n• Animal has: Name, Age, Eat(), Sleep()\n• Dog inherits ALL of those AND adds: Breed, Bark()\n\nInheritance promotes CODE REUSE - don't repeat yourself! Write common features once in the base class, share with all derived classes.",
