  "title": "Arrays (The Fixed-Size Shelf)",
  "simplifierConcept": "Imagine you buy a bookshelf with exactly 5 slots. You can put 5 books on it, no more, no less. Each slot has a number (0, 1, 2, 3, 4), and you can access any book directly: 'Give me the book in slot 3!'\n\nThat's an ARRAY! It's a collection of items:\n• Fixed size (decided when created - can't grow or shrink!)\n• All items must be the same type (all ints, all strings, etc.)\n• Accessed by index (position number, starting from 0!)\n\nWhy start at 0? Because programmers are weird! Seriously, it's a computer science convention. The FIRST item is at index 0, second at index 1, etc.\n\nArrays are FAST for accessing items (instant lookup!) but INFLEXIBLE (can't change size). Perfect for fixed data like days of the week, months, or game levels!",
  "coderExample": "// Creating arrays\nint[] scores = new int[5];  // Creates array with 5 empty slots\nscores[0] = 95;  // First item (index 0)\nscores[1] = 87;\nscores[2] = 92;\nscores[3] = 78;\nscores[4] = 88;  // Last item (index 4, not 5!)\n\n// Or initialize with values directly\nstring[] players = { \"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\" };\n\n// Accessing array items\nConsole.WriteLine(\"First player: \" + players[0]);  // Alice\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Third player: \" + players[2]);  // Charlie\n\n// Array length\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Number of players: \" + players.Length);\n\n// Looping through an array\nfor (int i = 0; i < scores.Length; i++)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Score \" + i + \": \" + scores[i]);\n}",
