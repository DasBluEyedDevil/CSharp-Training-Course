  "title": "What is a Variable? (The Labeled Box)",
  "simplifierConcept": "Imagine you have empty boxes in a warehouse, and you need to store things in them. Each box gets a LABEL (like 'Books' or 'Toys') so you know what's inside.\n\nVariables are exactly like labeled boxes! They're containers that store information in your program:\n\n• The LABEL is the variable name (like 'playerScore' or 'userName')\n• The CONTENTS are the value stored inside (like 100 or 'Alex')\n• You can look inside the box anytime by using its label\n• You can replace what's inside by putting new stuff in!\n\nIn C#, before you can use a box, you must tell the computer: \"I need a box for storing text\" or \"I need a box for storing numbers.\" This is called DECLARING a variable.",
  "coderExample": "// Create a variable (declare it)\nstring playerName;\n\n// Put something in the box (assign a value)\nplayerName = \"Alex\";\n\n// Look at what's in the box (use it)\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Player name: \" + playerName);\n\n// Put something new in the box (reassign)\nplayerName = \"Jordan\";\nConsole.WriteLine(\"New player: \" + playerName);",
  "syntaxBreakdown": [
    {
      "codeSnippet": "string playerName;",
      "explanation": "'string' means this box holds TEXT. 'playerName' is the label on the box. The semicolon ends the statement."
    },
    {
      "codeSnippet": "playerName = \"Alex\";",
      "explanation": "The = sign means 'put this value INTO the box'. We're storing the text 'Alex' in our playerName box."
    },
    {
      "codeSnippet": "Console.WriteLine(playerName);",
      "explanation": "No quotes around playerName! That tells C# to look INSIDE the box and get the value, not just display the word 'playerName'."

    "instructions": "Create a program that:\n1. Declares a variable called 'favoriteGame'\n2. Stores YOUR favorite game in it\n3. Displays a message like: 'My favorite game is [your game]'\n4. Changes the variable to a different game\n5. Displays the new game",
    "starterCode": "// Declare your variable\nstring favoriteGame;\n\n// Store your favorite game\n\n// Display it\n\n// Change it to a different game\n\n// Display the new one",

    "commonStickingPoints": [
      "Putting quotes around the variable name when using it: Console.WriteLine(\"favoriteGame\") displays the word 'favoriteGame', not the value!",
      "Forgetting to declare the variable first: You must write 'string favoriteGame;' before you can use it!",
      "Misspelling the variable name: 'favoriteGame' and 'favoritegame' are different! C# is case-sensitive!"
