  "simplifierConcept": "Imagine a school:\n\n• **INSTANCE (each student)**: Each student has their OWN name, grade, age. John's grade is different from Mary's grade.\n\n• **STATIC (shared by all)**: The school bell rings for EVERYONE. The school's name is the SAME for all students. These are SHARED, not personal.\n\nIn C#:\n• **Instance members**: Each object has its own copy. player1.score is different from player2.score.\n• **Static members**: Shared by ALL instances of the class. ONE copy for the whole class.\n\nWhen to use static?\n• Counters: How many Player objects exist? Player.Count (shared)\n• Utility methods: Math.Sqrt(), Console.WriteLine() - don't need a specific object!\n• Constants: Math.PI - same for everyone\n\nAccess static members through the CLASS NAME (Player.Count), not an object (player1.Count won't work)!",
