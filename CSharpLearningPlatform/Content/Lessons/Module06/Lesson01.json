  "title": "Why Object-Oriented Programming?",
  "simplifierConcept": "Imagine building 100 houses. Would you redesign each house from scratch? NO! You'd create a BLUEPRINT and build all houses from that blueprint!\n\nThat's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)! Instead of writing scattered variables and functions, you create BLUEPRINTS (called CLASSES) that define how things work. Then you build actual OBJECTS from those blueprints.\n\nWithout OOP:\nstring player1Name = 'Alice';\nint player1Score = 100;\nint player1Health = 80;\nstring player2Name = 'Bob';\nint player2Score = 150;\nint player2Health = 60;\n...(100 players = 300 variables!)\n\nWith OOP:\nCreate a Player blueprint once.\nPlayer alice = new Player('Alice', 100, 80);\nPlayer bob = new Player('Bob', 150, 60);\n\nOOP makes code ORGANIZED, REUSABLE, and SCALABLE. It's how professional software is built!",
  "coderExample": "// WITHOUT OOP - messy!\nstring playerName = \"Alice\";\nint playerScore = 100;\nint playerHealth = 80;\n\nvoid DisplayPlayer()\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(playerName + \": \" + playerScore + \" points, \" + playerHealth + \" HP\");\n}\n\n// WITH OOP - clean and organized!\nclass Player\n{\n    public string Name;\n    public int Score;\n    public int Health;\n    \n    public void Display()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(Name + \": \" + Score + \" points, \" + Health + \" HP\");\n    }\n}\n\n// Creating objects from the class\nPlayer alice = new Player();\nalice.Name = \"Alice\";\nalice.Score = 100;\nalice.Health = 80;\nalice.Display();\n\nPlayer bob = new Player();\nbob.Name = \"Bob\";\nbob.Score = 150;\nbob.Health = 60;\nbob.Display();",
