  "title": "Constructors (The Setup Crew)",
  "simplifierConcept": "When you build a house, there's a crew that sets everything up FIRST - they install the foundation, connect the water, turn on the electricity. Only THEN is the house ready to use!\n\nA CONSTRUCTOR is that setup crew for your objects! It's a special method that runs automatically when you create an object with 'new'. It initializes the object with starting values.\n\nWithout constructor (tedious):\nPlayer p = new Player();\np.Name = 'Alice';\np.Score = 0;\np.Health = 100;\n\nWith constructor (one line!):\nPlayer p = new Player('Alice', 0, 100);\n\nConstructors make object creation EASIER and SAFER - you can't forget to set important values!",
  "coderExample": "class Player\n{\n    public string Name;\n    public int Score;\n    public int Health;\n    \n    // Constructor - same name as class, no return type!\n    public Player(string name, int score, int health)\n    {\n        Name = name;\n        Score = score;\n        Health = health;\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Player created: \" + Name);\n    }\n    \n    public void Display()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(Name + \": \" + Score + \" points, \" + Health + \" HP\");\n    }\n}\n\n// Creating objects with constructor\nPlayer alice = new Player(\"Alice\", 100, 80);\nPlayer bob = new Player(\"Bob\", 150, 60);\n\nalice.Display();\nbob.Display();",

      "explanation": "You don't 'call' the constructor explicitly. It runs automatically when you use 'new Player(...)'. It's the first code that executes!"

      "Adding return type: public void Car(...) is WRONG! Constructors have NO return type, not even void! Just: public Car(...)",

      "Forgetting 'new': You still need 'new' when using a constructor! Player p = Player('Alice') is wrong - must be new Player('Alice').",
