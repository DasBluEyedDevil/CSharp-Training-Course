  "title": "Loop Control (break and continue)",
  "simplifierConcept": "Imagine you're reading through a book chapter by chapter:\n\n• BREAK: You find the answer you need on chapter 5. You say 'I'm done!' and CLOSE THE BOOK completely. You exit the loop!\n\n• CONTINUE: You're on chapter 3 and it's boring. You say 'Skip this chapter!' and jump to chapter 4. You stay in the loop, just skip THIS iteration!\n\nThese are CONTROL STATEMENTS that give you finer control over loops:\n\n**break** = Exit the loop IMMEDIATELY, no matter what. Jump to the code after the loop.\n\n**continue** = Skip the REST of this iteration and jump to the next one. The loop continues!\n\nThink of a security checkpoint:\n• break: 'Suspicious person found! Shut down the whole checkpoint!' (exit loop)\n• continue: 'This person is fine, next person please!' (skip to next iteration)",
  "coderExample": "// BREAK example - exit loop early\nfor (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Number: \" + i);\n    \n    if (i == 5)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Found 5! Exiting loop.\");\n        break;  // Exit the entire loop\n    }\n}\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Loop ended.\");\n// Only prints 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, then exits!\n\n// CONTINUE example - skip current iteration\nfor (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++)\n{\n    if (i % 2 == 0)  // If even number\n    {\n        continue;  // Skip the rest, go to next iteration\n    }\n    \n    Console.WriteLine(\"Odd number: \" + i);\n}\n// Only prints odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9\n\n// Real-world: Finding a player in a list\nstring[] players = {\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\", \"David\"};\nstring targetPlayer = \"Charlie\";\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < players.Length; i++)\n{\n    if (players[i] == targetPlayer)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Found player: \" + players[i]);\n        break;  // Found them, stop searching!\n    }\n}",

    "instructions": "Create a number analyzer!\n\n1. Use a for loop from 1 to 20\n2. Use CONTINUE to skip all even numbers (if i % 2 == 0, continue)\n3.

    "commonStickingPoints": [
      "Confusing break and continue: break EXITS the loop. continue SKIPS to next iteration. Very different behaviors!",
      "Using outside loops: break and continue ONLY work inside loops! Using them outside a loop causes a compile error.",
      "Unreachable code after break: Code after break in the same block never runs! if (x) { break; Console.WriteLine('hi'); } - 'hi' is unreachable!",
      "Continue logic errors: Putting continue before important code means that code gets skipped! Place your continue checks carefully."
