  "simplifierConcept": "Imagine you're organizing a tournament where every team plays every other team:\n\n• Outer loop: Go through each team (Team A, Team B, Team C...)\n• Inner loop: For THIS team, play against every OTHER team\n\nTeam A plays Team B, Team C, Team D...\nTeam B plays Team A, Team C, Team D...\nAnd so on!\n\nThat's a NESTED LOOP - a loop INSIDE another loop!\n\nThink of it like checking every seat in a theater:\n• Outer loop: Go through each ROW (Row 1, Row 2, Row 3...)\n• Inner loop: For THIS row, check each SEAT (Seat A, B, C...)\n\nRow 1, Seat A → Row 1, Seat B → ... → Row 2, Seat A → Row 2, Seat B...\n\nNested loops are powerful for grids, patterns, tables, or any time you need to do something for EVERY COMBINATION of two things!",

      "codeSnippet": "Outer loop",
      "explanation": "The outer loop runs ONCE per full cycle. If it runs 5 times, you get 5 'groups' or 'rows' of inner loop executions."

      "codeSnippet": "Inner loop",
      "explanation": "The inner loop runs COMPLETELY for EACH iteration of the outer loop! If outer runs 3 times and inner runs 4 times, inner executes 3×4 = 12 times total!"

      "codeSnippet": "Variable names",
      "explanation": "Use different variable names! Common pattern: i for outer, j for inner. Or use meaningful names: row/col, x/y, etc."

      "Using same variable name: for (int i...) { for (int i...) } is WRONG! Inner loop needs a different name: j, col, y, etc.",

      "Console.WriteLine vs Write: Use Write to print on same line, WriteLine to start a new line. Useful for patterns!",
