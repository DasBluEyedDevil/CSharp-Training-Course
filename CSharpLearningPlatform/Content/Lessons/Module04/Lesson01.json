  "simplifierConcept": "Imagine you need to write 'I will not talk in class' 100 times on the blackboard. You wouldn't write it once and think 'okay, done!' - you'd repeat it exactly 100 times.\n\nThat's what a FOR LOOP does! It repeats code a SPECIFIC number of times. You tell it:\n1. Where to start (I'm starting at line 1)\n2. When to stop (Keep going until I reach line 100)\n3. How to count (Add 1 each time)\n\nThink of it like a countdown: '10, 9, 8, 7...' or a count-up: '1, 2, 3, 4...'. The for loop handles the counting FOR you!\n\nThe for loop is PERFECT when you know EXACTLY how many times to repeat. Need to process 50 items? Use a for loop counting from 0 to 49. Need to print numbers 1 to 10? For loop!",

      "Using commas instead of semicolons: for (int i = 0, i < 10, i++) is WRONG! Use semicolons: for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)",

      "Forgetting the increment: for (int i = 0; i < 10; ) with no i++ creates an infinite loop! i never changes so i < 10 is always true."
