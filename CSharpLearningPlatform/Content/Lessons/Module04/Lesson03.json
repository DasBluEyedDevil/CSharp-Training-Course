  "title": "The do-while Loop (At Least Once)",
  "simplifierConcept": "Imagine a restaurant: 'Please tell me what you'd like to order.' They ask you at LEAST ONCE, even if you say 'I'm not hungry.' They don't check if you're hungry BEFORE asking - they ask FIRST, then check if you want more.\n\nThat's a DO-WHILE loop! It's like a while loop, but the condition is checked at the END, not the beginning. This guarantees the code runs AT LEAST ONCE!\n\nThink of it like trying a food sample at the grocery store:\n• Regular while: 'While you're hungry, take a sample' → If you're not hungry, you take ZERO samples\n• Do-while: 'Take a sample. Still hungry? Take another!' → You ALWAYS get at least one sample\n\nDo-while is perfect for menus, user input prompts, or anything where you need to do something at least once before checking a condition.",
  "coderExample": "// Regular while - might not run at all\nint x = 10;\nwhile (x < 5)  // False from the start\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"This never prints!\");\n}\n\n// Do-while - runs at least once!\nint y = 10;\ndo\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"This prints once, even though y is not < 5!\");\n} while (y < 5);  // Condition checked AFTER\n\n// Practical example: Menu system\nint choice;\ndo\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"\\n=== MENU ===\");\n    Console.WriteLine(\"1. Play Game\");\n    Console.WriteLine(\"2. Settings\");\n    Console.WriteLine(\"3. Quit\");\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Enter choice: \");\n    \n    // Simulating user input\n    choice = 1; // Pretend user chose 1\n    \n    if (choice == 1)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Starting game...\");\n    }\n    else if (choice == 2)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Opening settings...\");\n    }\n    \n    // Force exit for this example\n    choice = 3;\n    \n} while (choice != 3);\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Thanks for playing!\");",
