  "simplifierConcept": "You've been using comparisons like >= and ==, but there's a whole toolkit available! These are called COMPARISON OPERATORS, and they let you ask questions about values:\n\n• == (equals): Is this EXACTLY the same?\n• != (not equals): Is this DIFFERENT?\n• > (greater than): Is this BIGGER?\n• < (less than): Is this SMALLER?\n• >= (greater or equal): Is this bigger OR the same?\n• <= (less or equal): Is this smaller OR the same?\n\nBut what if you need to check MULTIPLE conditions? Like: 'If it's Saturday AND I have money, I'll go to the movies.'\n\nThat's where LOGICAL OPERATORS come in:\n• && (AND): BOTH conditions must be true\n• || (OR): AT LEAST ONE condition must be true\n• ! (NOT): Flips true to false, false to true\n\nThink of && like a bouncer checking TWO IDs: 'You need to be 21 AND have a ticket.' You need BOTH!",
